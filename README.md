### Pizza Menu
A menu used to order pizza, choosing its size and toppings from lists. It then takes the the input information and calculates the price.
### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The classic game of tic-tac-toe with the computer as the other player. It makes a sound when a square is chosen, when there is a tie, and when the game is won. It also draws a line through the winning three squares.
### Calculator
A basic 4-function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, or divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
### To-Do App
A basic To-Do application. Users can input a task and add each task to their "to-do" list. Later they can x out items as they finish them.
